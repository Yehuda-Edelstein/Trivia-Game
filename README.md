### Challanges Overcome

I had trouble figuring out the best way to have the game run as a loop. Eventually I settled on a recurring function that just keeps the game going, choosing questions and answers from an array of objects. 

Styling the game was another challenge as I am not such an artistic person, it was hard for me to make the site asthetic. In the end, I went for funtionality over pretty.
